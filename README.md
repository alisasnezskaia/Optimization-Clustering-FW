# Frank-Wolfe Algorithm Optimization Project

**Group 37** - Optimization Methods for Clustering

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project implements and analyzes Frank-Wolfe algorithm variants for clustering optimization problems. We focus on developing efficient implementations and testing them on regularized max-clique problems.

### Theoretical Analysis
- In-depth study of Frank-Wolfe algorithm theory
- Review of referenced papers:
  - `FW.pdf` - Core Frank-Wolfe theory
  - `FW_variants.pdf` - Algorithm variants
  - `FW_survey.pdf` - Comprehensive survey

### Implementation Requirements
Develop efficient implementations of three algorithms:
1. **Frank-Wolfe** (standard)
2. **Pairwise Frank-Wolfe**
3. **Away Step Frank-Wolfe**

**Optimization Tools:** Line search, Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO), and other efficiency enhancements

### Testing & Evaluation
Test algorithms on two problem formulations:
- **L2 regularized max-clique problem** (Section 3, equation 31 in `clustering.pdf`)
- **L0 regularized max-clique problem** (Section 3, equation 33 in `clustering.pdf`)

**Datasets:** 4 DIMACS Instances:
- `brock200_4.clq.b` - Hidden clique structure (brock family, ~200 nodes)
- `C250.9.clq.b` - High density random graph (C family, 250 nodes, 90% edges)
- `DSJC500_5.clq.b` - Large sparse graph (DSJC family, 500 nodes, 5% edges)
- `keller4.clq.b` - Geometric structure (keller family, 171 nodes)

**Analysis:** Results visualization through plots and tables
